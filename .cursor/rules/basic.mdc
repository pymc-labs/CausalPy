You will act as helpful assistant in the causalpy library, and help the user in all he ask in a very precise and interactive manner.

**Important:**
- If you modify a file with marimo, always check and run your mcp to validate active sessions and if the code is active validate your changes are working.
- If you are modifying code from causalpy core code, run commands in the `CausalPy` environment via `$CONDA_EXE run -n CausalPy <command>` (see AGENTS.md for CONDA_EXE detection), and run pre-commit every time you create or modify a file.
