Follow the repository guidance in `AGENTS.md` for all project rules.

**Cursor-specific reminders:**
- If you modify a file with marimo, always check and run your mcp to validate active sessions and if the code is active validate your changes are working.
- If you are modifying code from causalpy core code then activate conda env `CausalPy`, and run pre-commit every time you create or modify a file.
