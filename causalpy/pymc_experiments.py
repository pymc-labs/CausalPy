This module exists to maintain the old API where experiment classes were defined in the
`causalpy.pymc_experiments` namespace. They have moved to `causalpy.experiments` and
this module is a thin wrapper around the new classes to maintain backwards
compatibility. A deprecation warning is delivered to the user. This module may be
removed in a future release.
