    "## Background: What is an Event Study?\n",
    "\n",
    "An event study analyzes panel data where some units receive treatment at a specific time. Unlike standard difference-in-differences which estimates a single average treatment effect, event studies estimate **separate coefficients for each time period relative to treatment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concept is **event time** (or relative time):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{it} = t - G_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is the calendar time and $G_i$ is the treatment time for unit $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model estimates {cite:t}`sun2021estimating`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_{it} = \\alpha_i + \\lambda_t + \\sum_{k \\neq k_0} \\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\{E_{it} = k\\} + \\varepsilon_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\alpha_i$ are unit fixed effects\n",
    "- $\\lambda_t$ are time fixed effects\n",
    "- $\\beta_k$ are the dynamic treatment effects at event time $k$\n",
    "- $k_0$ is the reference (omitted) period, typically $k=-1$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- $\\beta_k$ for $k < 0$ (pre-treatment): Should be near zero if parallel trends hold\n",
    "- $\\beta_k$ for $k \\geq 0$ (post-treatment): Measure the causal effect at each period after treatment\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning}\n",
    "This implementation uses a standard two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator, which requires **simultaneous treatment timing** - all treated units must receive treatment at the same time. Staggered adoption designs (where different units are treated at different times) can produce biased estimates when treatment effects vary across cohorts {footcite:t}`sun2021estimating`.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event studies** provide richer information than standard DiD by estimating treatment effects at each event time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pre-trend analysis** is crucial: the `effect_summary()` method automatically checks whether pre-treatment coefficients ($k < 0$) are consistent with the parallel trends assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic effects** can reveal how treatment impacts evolve over time—whether effects are immediate, gradual, or temporary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The reference period** ($k_0$, typically -1) is normalized to zero. All coefficients are interpreted relative to this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bayesian estimation** provides full posterior distributions for each coefficient, enabling probabilistic statements about effect sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Time-varying predictors** can be included in the model formula to control for confounders. The `generate_event_study_data` function supports generating AR(1) predictors with user-specified coefficients for realistic simulations.\n"
