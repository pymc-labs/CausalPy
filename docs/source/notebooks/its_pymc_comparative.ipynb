    "# Geo-Experimentation with Comparative Interrupted Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates Comparative Interrupted Time Series (CITS) analysis using a geo-experimentation example. The analysis is based on the approach described in [Juan Orduz's blog post on time-based regression for geo-experiments](https://juanitorduz.github.io/time_based_regression_pymc/), which is partially based on the paper \"Estimating Ad Effectiveness using Geo Experiments in a Time-Based Regression Framework\" by Vaver & Koehler (2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Comparative Interrupted Time Series?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparative Interrupted Time Series (CITS)** extends the standard Interrupted Time Series (ITS) design by incorporating control units as predictors in the model. This approach provides stronger causal inference by accounting for common trends and shocks that affect both treated and control units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of CITS:\n",
    "- Uses the `InterruptedTimeSeries` class with control units as predictors\n",
    "- Formula includes control unit observations: `treated ~ 1 + control_1 + control_2 + ...`\n",
    "- Can include an intercept (unlike Synthetic Control)\n",
    "- No sum-to-1 constraint on control weights (unlike Synthetic Control)\n",
    "- Provides a middle ground between ITS and Synthetic Control methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison: ITS vs CITS vs Synthetic Control\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | ITS | CITS | Synthetic Control |\n",
    "|--------|-----|------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Control units** | None (or not in predictors) | Yes, as predictors | Yes, as predictors |\n",
    "| **Intercept** | Typically yes | Yes | Typically no |\n",
    "| **Weight constraint** | N/A | None | Sum to 1 |\n",
    "| **Interpretation** | Counterfactual from time trends | Counterfactual from controls + trends | Weighted combination of controls |\n",
    "| **Use case** | Single unit, strong trends | Multiple units, common trends | Multiple units, parallel trajectories |\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "When predictors in the model are **not** control units (e.g., just time, seasonality, or other covariates), you have standard **ITS**. When you include one or more control units as predictors, you have **CITS**.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CITS provides robust causal inference** by using control units to account for common trends and external shocks\n",
    "2. **The `InterruptedTimeSeries` class is flexible** - it can handle standard ITS (no control predictors), CITS (control predictors), and various model specifications\n",
    "3. **Pre-treatment fit is crucial** - a good model fit in the pre-period gives us confidence in the counterfactual predictions\n",
    "4. **Uncertainty quantification matters** - Bayesian credible intervals tell us the range of plausible effects, not just a point estimate\n",
    "5. **CITS sits between ITS and Synthetic Control** - it borrows strength from controls without the strict constraints of Synthetic Control\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use CITS?\n",
    "\n",
    "CITS is particularly useful when:\n",
    "- You have good control units that track the treated unit in the pre-period\n",
    "- You want to allow for an intercept shift between treatment and control\n",
    "- You don't want to impose sum-to-1 constraints on control weights\n",
    "- You have time-varying confounders that affect all units similarly\n",
    "- You're analyzing geo-experiments, marketing tests, or policy evaluations with clear control groups"
